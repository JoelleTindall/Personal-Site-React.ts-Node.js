WIP - Lots to do here -

A simple personal website for myself.
npm run dev on front and back ends to start up
postgresdb required (init.sql can be used to recreate db, will be automated once dockerfiles are all set up.)

todo (required):
- make an actual readme
- set up proxy for backend routes
- form validation
- test on mobile screens (should be responsive already, though)
- docker

todo (for fun)
- make more content for the site

changes 6/5:

-added login page
-authentication required to access 'uploads' page
-projects can be uploaded via 'uploads' page and are displayed dynamically from the db

changes 6/1:

-added image uploading (unfinished, but uploads project info and picture to db)
